    title: "Emphasize Non-Combustible Construction",
    content: "Wildfires gain momentum when they encounter flammable materials. Upgrading rooftops, siding, and eaves to non-combustible or highly fire-resistant products (such as Class A roofing, stucco, or fiber-cement cladding) significantly lowers a building's ignition risk. These \"hardened\" structures are far more resilient to flying embers—often the primary cause of home ignition. Properly sealed vents and attic openings also prevent embers from entering hidden spaces that can ignite an otherwise fire-safe structure.",
    keyTakeaway: "Buildings made of fire-resistant materials don't add fuel to the fire and become less likely to burn when embers land on them.",

    title: "Reduce Local Fuel to Lower Fire Temperature",
    content: "When vegetation and combustible items around homes are minimized or replaced with non-flammable, well-maintained landscaping (e.g., succulents, rock mulch, gravel pathways), there's far less fuel to support a high-intensity fire. Fire-resistant plants, hardscaped \"fuel breaks,\" and adequate spacing between structures ensure that any flames or embers that do arrive find little to sustain long-lasting combustion.",
    keyTakeaway: "If a neighborhood has limited burnable fuel, ground-level temperatures remain lower—even when embers blow in from large external fires.",

    title: "Control Ember Flow with Strategic Design",
    content: "Though the main fire might stay outside a community, wind-blown embers can travel significant distances. Strategically placed features—such as windbreaks, ember traps, or berms—disrupt airflow and cause embers to lose momentum. Perpendicular or staggered walls, contour berms, and funnel-and-pit designs can intercept and extinguish embers before they ignite structures. While these measures require careful engineering and ongoing maintenance, they can dramatically reduce the volume and intensity of embers entering a neighborhood.",
    keyTakeaway: "Physical barriers and ember traps can slow or stop embers, offering crucial extra protection beyond traditional building codes.",

    title: "Prepare for External Heat Sources",
    content: "A well-hardened community can still be exposed to high radiant heat and swirling embers if massive wildfires rage nearby. Even if the local environment is fuel-poor, severe winds and extreme temperatures can blow over from an active firefront. This reality underscores the importance of layered defenses—fire-rated construction, defensible landscaping, water access, and emergency response readiness.",
    keyTakeaway: "Holistic planning helps a community survive external extremes. No single measure is foolproof.",

    title: "Ongoing Maintenance and Policy Support",
    content: "Finally, a robust initial design won't remain effective without regular upkeep. Clearing dead leaves, testing sprinklers or misting systems, and ensuring building materials stay in good repair is crucial. Additionally, local governments and homeowner associations can promote retrofits for older homes and enforce consistent fire-safe codes. Coordinated policy, funding, and community engagement are essential to maintain these protective measures long-term.",
    keyTakeaway: "Sustained vigilance—through both maintenance and policy—ensures that fire defenses don't fail over time.",
